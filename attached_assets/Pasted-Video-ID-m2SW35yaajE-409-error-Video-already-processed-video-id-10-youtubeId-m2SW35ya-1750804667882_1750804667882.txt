here to talk to","you about the open Quantum systems","theory of ultra weak ultraviolet Photon","emissions in this lecture I'll be","revisiting gert's onion experiment as a","prototype for Quantum","biology this is work that I've recently","published in the computational and","structural biotechnology Journal uh so","if you find this work interesting please","feel welcome to check it out it's freely","available open access and it was","published December","2024 so what are Ultra weak Photon","emissions Ultra weak Photon emissions or","up are extremely faint light signals","emitted by living organisms these fall","mainly within the UVA visible and","infrared range of the light spectrum and","they're mainly caused by oxidative","stress metagenetic up are distinct from","UVA visible IR upe because they fall","into the UVB and UVC spectral Regions","they're associated with experimental","research on non-chemical communication","that may occur between living cells the","concept of mitro gentic radiation","challenges traditional views of cellular","communication by proposing that cells","can interact through the emission and","absorption of extremely weak light","signals Alexander gerit first identified","byog genetic radiation in the","1920s and it's potential role in cell","division in his experiments on onion","roots in the figure shown here we have","an onion held at the top with its root","extending down and another onion to the","left with the root coming forward so","that the tip of what is called the","emitter route sits facing the side of","the so-call receiver route now in this","setup it was found that cells on the","side of the receiver route facing the","tip divided more rapidly than cells on","the opposite side it was then proposed","uh based on subsequent","experiments that it was actually the","emission of light from the emitter root","tip that induced enhanced mitosis that","is cell division in the receiver","route uh further research in the","development of the mitogenic concept","implicated a role for non-classical","resonance phenomena in mediating the F","effect and today I'll be talking about","an open Quantum systems approach to","explaining this effect based on gert's","historic observations although the","mechanism of up enhanced mitosis is not","known the theory involves two Factor","control for cell replication the","internal Readiness of a cell for","division and an external signal","prompting the that division gert's onion","experiment demonstrates this concept","showing replication in receiver cells","induced by ultraweak Photon emission","from neighboring emitter cells the","proposed framework suggests that cells","are not only capable of producing","ultraweak Photon emissions which is well","known but also of detecting and","responding to emissions from other cells","which stimulate the process of mitosis","as","follows as I mentioned the first step is","the internal Readiness of the receiver","cell as the cell prepares division based","on internal metabolic factors then upe","must be produced from neighboring cells","which emit Ultra weak photons the signal","must be received by the Target cell uh","as it absorbs the photon and as a result","enhanced mitosis can occur as the upe","signal prompts or enhances existing cell","division Research into mitro gentic","radiation has yielded significant","findings particularly regarding the","spectral range intensity and","characteristic aspects of the mechanism","of mitro gentic ultra week Photon","emissions the spectral range of the","mitogenic upe is around 190 to 280","nanometers essentially in the UVC range","of the spectrum although some effects","have been detected uh in the presence of","visible light up to 326 nanometers","the primary effect is to initiate most","likely protein synthesis oxidation","reactions and as a result cell division","the emission source is in metabolically","active or possibly also stressed cells","that have been stimulated uh","artificially in the laboratory and the","optimal conditions for reception of","mitogenic radiation is in weakened cells","in specific uh low light environments","where the sample preparation of the","receiver cells was very important","important to reproducing the effect","although many Laboratories were able to","successfully reproduce the bogetic","effect uh replication issues and lack of","consistent protocols led to widespread","skepticism of the research experimental","compounds were likely due to","insufficient Technologies and","misunderstandings of the necessary","controls including the quality quity of","UV transparent materials that were","necessary as well as the quality of","sample","preparations in essence uh the","replication issues uh that is to say","difficulties in consistently reproducing","experimental results across different","Laboratories worldwide could be","attributed mainly to protocol","inconsistencies due to a lack of","standardized methods for sample","preparation as well as for upe detection","and measurement now part of of this was","simply due to technological limitations","as early experiments were hampered by","insufficient sensitivity in light","detection equipment or even so-called","biological detectors uh which required","the preparation of living samples in","order to detect the extremely faint upe","emissions now the many complicated steps","involved in carrying out these","experiments led to a number of control","misunderstandings and as a result uh in","consideration uh inadequate","consideration of factors like UV","transparency of materials uh necessary","exposure times and cell sample","conditions uh created problems uh with a","number of groups and as a result uh the","effect uh fell into disrepute and was","even uh called at one","point pathological","science although many of these issues","can be accounted for by methodological","deviations between different","Laboratories an underlying problem is","the lack of an essential theory in order","to explain the effect and as a result I","propos that a modern approach to","understanding mitogenic radiation will","employ open Quantum systems theory and","resonance Concepts to explain gert's","observation based on the hypothesis that","upe induced mitosis results from a","resonance effect that is influenced by","cellular metabolic","conditions uh the application of open","Quantum systems principles to","biosystems uh in fact considering","environmental interactions and Dynamics","is essential to the development of a","resonance Theory to explain how specific","frequencies of upe Might resonate with","cellular structures and processes","ultimately uh we consider how metabolic","chain reactions and environmental","factors that affect up emission and","reception ultimately are involved in","controlling the","effect the open Quantum systems theory","of upe mechanisms uh offers to explain","these using nonlinear Optical phenomena","and Quantum resonance Concepts this","approach may help to explain up","conversion of photon energy enabling the","reception of upe by living cells","stochastic resonance another form of","noise enhanced resonance may also play a","role in amplifying Ultra weak","ultraviolet Photon emission signals","within cells these theoretical models","suggest that enhanced Photon","interactions and multiphoton absorption","are possible ways that extremely weak","light emissions could influence cellular","processes uh we're considering Quantum","effects especially nonlinear Optical","phenomena which may explain two Photon","up conversion and the possibility that","resonances can can further enhance what","are
