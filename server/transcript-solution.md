# YouTube Transcript Extraction Solution

## Current Issue
YouTube blocks ALL transcript extraction from cloud infrastructure IPs (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Replit).

## Working Solution from Your Attachment
The code you shared works because it likely runs from:
1. A residential/non-cloud IP address
2. An environment with YouTube authentication cookies
3. A proxy setup that masks the cloud provider IP

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Local Extraction Service
Run transcript extraction from your local machine and push results to cloud database:

```python
# Run this locally on your machine (not in Replit)
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

def extract_and_upload(video_ids):
    for video_id in video_ids:
        try:
            transcript = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)
            # Upload to your Replit database via API
            upload_transcript_to_cloud(video_id, transcript)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed: {video_id} - {e}")
```

### Option 2: Authentication Cookies
Set YOUTUBE_COOKIES environment variable with browser cookies:

```bash
# Export cookies from your browser and set as env var
export YOUTUBE_COOKIES="session=abc123; other_cookie=xyz789"
```

### Option 3: Proxy Integration
Use residential proxy service to mask cloud IP:

```python
import requests

proxies = {
    'http': 'http://residential-proxy-service.com:8080',
    'https': 'https://residential-proxy-service.com:8080'
}

# Apply to youtube-transcript-api requests
```

## Current Database Status
- 27 videos marked as "indexed" 
- All using placeholder transcripts (not real content)
- Stanford videos like "Stanford CS229: Machine Learning - Lecture 1" have fake transcripts
- No authentic lecture content has been extracted yet

## Recommendation
Since your attached file shows this working, the best solution is:
1. Run the transcript extraction locally (where it works)
2. Upload the real transcripts to the cloud database
3. Keep the cloud system for everything else (UI, AI processing, etc.)

This hybrid approach gives you real transcripts while keeping the full system functional.
